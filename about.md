{% capture lede_content %}
In 1923, forty years before the heyday of Don Draper, one of America's first ad clubs was dreamed up in a hotel room in cosmopolitan Portland, Maine. In the century since – first as the _Portland Advertising Club,_ then the _Advertising Club of Greater Portland_ (and then _of Maine_), and now as <span style="font-variant-caps:all-small-caps">MADE</span> – generations of Maine creative professionals have come together to connect, create, and celebrate everything that makes us tick.
